WEB VERSION->

Alertify app notifies drivers to make space for emergency vehicles One can login as user if he/she wants to contribute to the cause. Or one can login as Emergency Vehicle driver who is currently driving it.
In web there are major three pages. First for general public information ,Second is for Organisations to track there vehicles and third is for for creating usernames and passwords for registration.
Making these three we used HTML, JS , CSS , FIREBASE and GOOGLE MAPS API .

In India more than 24,000 people die everyday :( due to delay in emergency services . Our project works on the very same problem.
